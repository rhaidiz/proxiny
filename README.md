# Proxiny

Just a prototype to play around with Go and JSON-RPC.

Proxiny is a small proxy that communicates with JSON-RPC with a Java GUI.
The Go proxy is implemented with [elazarl/goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy) while the JSON communication is implemented with [gorillatoolkit](https://github.com/gorilla/rpc) in Go and [arteam/simple-json-rpc](https://github.com/arteam/simple-json-rpc) in the Java GUI.
